# StochasticOscillators
Julia code to semiclassically solve a single harmonic oscillator coupled to a bosonic environment. This is the code used to generate the data in the [Tutorial on the stochastic simulation of dissipative quantum oscillators](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/161/7/071501/3309129/Tutorial-on-the-stochastic-simulation-of) paper.
